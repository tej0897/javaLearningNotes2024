String:

All other datatypes are primitive, where as String datatype is "Reference" type.

Hence, there is no fixed size for String.


Primitive Vs Reference datatypes:
    
    1. There are 8 primitive datatypes where as there are unlimited Reference types. (they are user defined)

    2. Primitive stores data where as Reference stores an address.

    3. Primitive can hold only one value where as Reference can hold more than one value.

    4. Primitive takes less memory and are faster where as Reference takes more memory and is slower.
