What is an Algorithm?
    An Algorithm describes the steps we have to perform to accomplish a specific task.

    Example: Steps to make tea.

Algorithm vs Implementation:

    Algorithm is just steps to complete a task.

    Implementation is the code we write to accomplish the given task.

    There can be different Implementations for one specific algorithm.

Side Note:
    1. There can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task. (making tea)

    2. There can be many Implementations of the same algorithm.
