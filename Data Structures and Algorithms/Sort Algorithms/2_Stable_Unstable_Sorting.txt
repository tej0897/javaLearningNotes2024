Stable Vs Unstable comes to play when there are duplicate values in the data that we are sorting.

Example:

    Array:  5  9  3  9  8  4
    Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5


    In the above example, there are two 9(s). The question here is, post sorting, will the original ordering of the two nines be preserved? (will the 9 at index 1 swap with the 9 at index 3)


            **********


Stable: The relative ordering of the duplicate values will be preserved after sorting. (ALWAYS PREFERRED)

Unstable: The relative ordering of the duplicate values will not be preserved after sorting.


            **********


Why Stable sort is preferred if there are duplicates?

    For integers, it does not make a difference. But when sorting Objects, it matters.

    Example: If we are sorting an object and we are doing multiple sorts like first sorting by name and then by age and then by gender etc..

    if the second sort causes the result of first sort to flip, then it will be a problem as we will not get the desired result.
