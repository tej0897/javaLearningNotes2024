Things to measure the efficiency of a code:
    
    * We cannot add a timer at the start of the code and a timer at the end of the code and get the runtime of the algorithm / program cause the runtime will be lesser in a super computer when compared to a regular computer.

    * The best way to figure out the efficiency of the code is by using Time complexity and Memory complexity.


            **********


Time Complexity: (important)
    Number of steps involved to run an algorithm. 

Memory Complexity: (Not that important)
    Amount of memory it takes to run an algorithm.


            **********


More about Time complexity:

    * We are not calculating the best case scenario as we will rarely have the best case. 

    * We will not look into average case as it will not tell us the absolute worst time complexity.

    * We will figure out what is the absolute worst we can expect from this algorithm.

    * We compare the worst case scenario for one algorithm with worst case scenario of another algorithm to see which is better.
