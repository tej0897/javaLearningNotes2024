What is an array?

    * Contains elements of a similar type.

    * Elements are stored in contigious memory location.
    * Can store only fixed set of elements.

    * Index based, 1st element is stored in 0th index, 2nd in 1st index and so on.

    * We can store primitive values or objects in an array.

Advantages:
    * we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.

    * Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.


            **********


Disadvantages:

    * Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array.

    * It doesn't grow its size at runtime.

    * To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

Syntax:

    int array [] = new int[5];
        //declaration and instantiation


    int array [] = {33,3,4,5};
        //declaration, instantiation and initialization
