@SpringBootApplication

This annotation is composed of 3 sub-annotations:
    a. @EnableAutoConfiguration
    b. @ComponentScan
    c. @Configuration


            **********

@EnableAutoConfiguration:
    It enables the auto-configuration of Spring ApplicationContext by scanning the classpath components and registering the beans.


@ComponentScan:
    Enables component scanning of current package and also recursively scans sub-packages.


@Configuration:
    Able to register extra beans with @Bean or import other configuration classes.


            **********

@ComponentScan:

    1. It will scan components in main class level and package below class level. If there are sub-packages below that, it will not scan.

    2. To specify ComponentScan which packages to scan, we can mention the package names like the example below:

    @SpringBootApplication(
            scanBasePackages={"
                    "com.test.example",
                    "org.test.example2",
                    "edu.test.example3"
            "})
